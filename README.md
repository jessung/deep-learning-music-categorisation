# deep-learning-music-classification
This is a project that aims to develop the best possible deep learning algorithm to accurately categorise audio files into music genres.


For the purpose of this project, the dataset used will be the GTZAN music classification dataset. It consists of audio files belonging to one of ten different music genres, with each genre having 100 different audio files of 30 seconds length. Each audio file also has a corresponding image that serves as its visual representation, as well as two CSV files. One CSV file has the extracted features of each audio file, while the other has the same extracted features, but with each of the audio files split into 10 files, in order to increase the size of the dataset if needed.
